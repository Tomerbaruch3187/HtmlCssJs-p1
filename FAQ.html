                        or an "official" Mardi Gras website. Using the term “official” is just a way for vendors to sell
                        their products or services to those who do not know better. Products or websites are not
                        licensed by the government for Mardi Gras. Each individual parade krewe is responsible for all
                        of its merchandise. In some parts of the country, official organizations control their Mardi
                        Gras celebration, but this is not true in New Orleans.

                        <br><br>

                        Fat Tuesday changes every year because Easter Sunday is never on the same Sunday each year. Fat
                        Tuesday is always the day before Ash Wednesday.

                        Most visitors plan to arrive no later than the Saturday prior to Mardi Gras day and stay through
                        Ash Wednesday.

                    <div class="accordion-body">By all means, yes! Contrary to public perception, Mardi Gras is a family
                        celebration. Those of us who grew up in New Orleans feel guilty once our children have grown up
                        and we continue going to every parade because we used to use "taking the children" as our
                        excuse! Bring big bags (even large garbage bags!) to hold all of the stuff they will catch.
                        Throws often include toys, stuffed animals, beads, and more.
                        <br><br>
                        The only place you should avoid with kids is the French Quarter (where no full-size parades pass
                        anyway). We recommend seeing the parades when they begin on St. Charles Avenue near Napoleon
                        since parades can last until 11 p.m. near the end of the route. The Garden District portion of
                        St. Charles is a family area where you will see many families staking out their parade watching
                        position, having picnics, playing ball, and having fun under the beautiful oak trees. You don't
                        have to worry about the streetcars, as they stop running in this area during Mardi Gras.
                        <br><br>
                        You may also want to consider taking your kids to the parades in suburban areas like Metairie,
                        which is only 10 minutes away from New Orleans. Metairie's Caesar parade, the Saturday before
                        Mardi Gras weekend, is the parade Disneyworld features on Mardi Gras day. Kids love it!
